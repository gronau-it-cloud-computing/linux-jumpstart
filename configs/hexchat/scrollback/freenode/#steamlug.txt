T 1379720424 18<weltall>	yes you are
T 1379720493 20<sluidfoe>30	swordfischer: cool. I had Steam running on gentoo before, but my laptop died. What method of installation is considered best now? I think I was using gamerlay before.
T 1379720533 18<meklu>	gamerlay is what I've been using
T 1379720535 18<swordfischer>	I use the 'steam-overlay' but I believe gamerlay is considered the stable'r overlay for steam
T 1379720546 18<swordfischer>	both works fine however
T 1379720563 23*	dyrvere (~dyrver@unaffiliated/dyrvere) has joined
T 1379720565 18<meklu>	and the ebuild was games-util/steam-launcher
T 1379720632 19<salamanderrake>	sluidfoe, I am a gentoo user.
T 1379720635 18<kisak>	I use steam-overlay
T 1379720719 18<salamanderrake>	there is one problem atm with either steam-overlay or gamerlay since the official release of sdl2, the steam-launcher depends on libsdl2 which is provided by the overlay but there is a libsdl-2 which is in portage.

T 1379720730 18<kisak>	right now it's annoying to get started with those ebuilds because it assumes a multilib environment for the most part
T 1379720747 18<salamanderrake>	wait hold on
T 1379720752 18<kisak>	salamanderrake: not anymore
T 1379720775 18<salamanderrake>	or its the inverse
T 1379720790 18<kisak>	it was the inverse, but not anymore
T 1379720796 18<salamanderrake>	ok
T 1379720799 18<salamanderrake>	what happened?
T 1379720799 18*	swordfischer pads anYc for doing a great job with steam-overlay
T 1379720821 18<kisak>	anYc: put in a blocker and switched to conform to portage
T 1379720831 18<salamanderrake>	ah ok
T 1379720839 18<salamanderrake>	so I need to reinstall steam-launcher then?
T 1379720841 18<kisak>	anYc: that wasn't directed at you
T 1379720861 18<kisak>	salamanderrake: there's nothing functional to gain yet
T 1379720878 18<kisak>	salamanderrake: I'm assuming you're on the release version of libsdl2?
T 1379720896 18<salamanderrake>	maybe
T 1379720909 18<salamanderrake>	so libsdl2 is the official ebuild in portage?
T 1379720914 18<kisak>	there's not much to gain, it's just package naming
T 1379720931 18<kisak>	salamanderrake: yes
T 1379720943 18<salamanderrake>	ok
T 1379720969 18<salamanderrake>	I need to update steam-lanucher to fix the dependency issue where its trying to pull in libsdl-2.0.0
T 1379721019 18<kisak>	I probably should mention that libsdl2 in portage isn't usable for steam because it is not multilib
T 1379721027 18<kisak>	(on 64 bit)
T 1379721044 18<salamanderrake>	for me it is. I use multilib portage
T 1379721061 18<kisak>	captain fancy pants
T 1379721067 18<salamanderrake>	but I need to set it up for it
T 1379721179 18<salamanderrake>	now they just need the rest of the sdl2 lib packages
T 1379721212 18<salamanderrake>	never mind they are in there
T 1379721287 18<meklu>	wonder if I should switch from multilib portage's MULTILIB_ABI_X86 to ABI_X86
T 1379721351 20<sluidfoe>30	got it working. Thanks, guys
T 1379721359 18<salamanderrake>	why do I need cups for steam?
T 1379721376 18<Cheeseness>	salamanderrake: For all that printing
T 1379721382 18<salamanderrake>	meklu, hold off for a bit let the dust settle and the blood get cleaned up.
T 1379721397 18<meklu>	fine by me
T 1379721398 18<kisak>	there's a print receipt function when you activate a game, right?
T 1379721415 18<meklu>	I think so
T 1379721418 18<salamanderrake>	eventually everyone will go to the portage eclass 32bit stuff anyways
T 1379721423 18<salamanderrake>	ah ok
T 1379721429 18<meklu>	it might be a webkit thing too
T 1379721435 18<meklu>	cool cool
T 1379721480 18<salamanderrake>	meklu what version of nvidia-drivers do you have installed?
